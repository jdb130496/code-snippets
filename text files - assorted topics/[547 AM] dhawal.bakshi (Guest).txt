Sunilbhai, I hope, as assured by Mohitji, my payment will be released ultimately.

Sunilbhai As my payment has been held, unless it is released, I am hesitant to release IT assets as I will not have anything to fallback on if Mohit later backs out. I do not trust him at all after all these experiences. Please ensure that my payment is released first.

Besides, you will appreciate that I am not enforcing 3 months notice period as mentioned in the contract.

Thank you Sunilbhai for all the help till now. Requesting you to arrange to let someone from Baroda office come in car and pick up IT assets so that reimbursement question does not arise. Sorry, but I do not wish to keep anything as an open item to be settled at a later stage (reimbursement).  If as per procedure, payment will be released after that, let it be. I will keep assets ready with all cables, etc. dismantled.  I am sure, QX Baroda office will have someone who will do that.
