Find out and correct error in this bash command which seeks to replace string using pcre2 perl patterns:$ cd "$(perl -pe 's|^([A-Za-z]):|/\L$1|e; s|\\\\|/|g' <<< $'D:\\dump\\Religious Books PDF And Audio')"
Search pattern not terminated at -e line 1.EditLooking at your bash command, I can see the issue. The problem is with the PCRE2 perl pattern - specifically, the search pattern isn't properly terminated because of how the single quotes are being handled within the here-string.
The error occurs because when you use $'D:\\dump\\Religious Books PDF And Audio', the backslashes are being interpreted by the shell before reaching perl, and the single quotes within the perl command are conflicting with the here-string syntax.
Here's the corrected command:
bashcd "$(perl -pe 's|^([A-Za-z]):|/\L$1|e; s|\\\\|/|g' <<< "D:\\dump\\Religious Books PDF And Audio")"
The key changes:

Replaced $'...' with "..." - This prevents the shell from pre-processing the backslashes
Used double quotes around the input string to avoid quote conflicts

Alternatively, you could escape the backslashes properly:
bashcd "$(perl -pe 's|^([A-Za-z]):|/\L$1|e; s|\\\\|/|g' <<< 'D:\\dump\\Religious Books PDF And Audio')"
Or use a here-document approach:
bashcd "$(perl -pe 's|^([A-Za-z]):|/\L$1|e; s|\\\\|/|g' <<EOF
D:\\dump\\Religious Books PDF And Audio
EOF
)"
The corrected command should convert your Windows path D:\dump\Religious Books PDF And Audio to /d/dump/Religious Books PDF And Audio (Unix-style path with lowercase drive letter).RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.DProblem is like this:
I want to pipe changed pattern from 'D:\dump\Religious Books PDF And Audio' to '/d/dump/Religious Books PDF And Audio' in side cd command in bash on Msys2EditI understand! You want to convert a Windows path to a Unix-style path (like Git Bash/MSYS2 format) and use it directly in the cd command. The issue with your original command is the quote handling.
Here's the corrected command:
bashcd "$(echo 'D:\dump\Religious Books PDF And Audio' | perl -pe 's|^([A-Za-z]):|/\L$1|; s|\\\\|/|g')"
Or more concisely using a here-string with proper quoting:
bashcd "$(perl -pe 's|^([A-Za-z]):|/\L$1|; s|\\\\|/|g' <<< 'D:\dump\Religious Books PDF And Audio')"
Key fixes:

Removed the e flag from the first substitution - it was causing the "Search pattern not terminated" error
Used single quotes around the input path to prevent shell interpretation of backslashes
Simplified the regex - s|\\\\|/|g should be s|\\|/|g since we're only dealing with single backslashes in the input

Actually, let me correct that last point. For the backslash replacement, you want:
bashcd "$(perl -pe 's|^([A-Za-z]):|/\L$1|; s|\\|/|g' <<< 'D:\dump\Religious Books PDF And Audio')"
This will convert D:\dump\Religious Books PDF And Audio to /d/dump/Religious Books PDF And Audio and then change to that directory.
The regex breakdown:

s|^([A-Za-z]):|/\L$1| - Converts D: to /d (drive letter to lowercase)
s|\\|/|g - Converts all backslashes to forward slashes
RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.DCan you not do it without echo? Straight using perl pcre2?EditYes! The issue in your original command is that you need to remove the e flag from the first substitution. The e flag treats the replacement as Perl code to be evaluated, which is causing the syntax error.
Here's the corrected command:
bashcd "$(perl -pe 's|^([A-Za-z]):|/\L$1|; s|\\|/|g' <<< 'D:\dump\Religious Books PDF And Audio')"
The key fix is removing the e flag from s|^([A-Za-z]):|/\L$1|e to make it s|^([A-Za-z]):|/\L$1|.
The \L (lowercase) modifier works fine without the e flag for this simple case. The e flag was causing Perl to try to evaluate $1 as code rather than just using it as a replacement string with the \L modifier.
This will convert:

D:\dump\Religious Books PDF And Audio
to /d/dump/Religious Books PDF And Audio

And then cd to that directory.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.DYeah! Correct! That worked!EditGreat! Glad that worked for you. The e flag in Perl regex substitutions can be tricky - it's only needed when you want to execute actual Perl code in the replacement, but for simple case conversions like \L, it's not necessary and can actually cause parsing issues like you experienced.
Your command is now cleanly converting Windows paths to MSYS2/Git Bash format in one go - pretty handy for cross-platform scripting!
