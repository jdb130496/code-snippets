VS Code: The error message indicates that the `llvm-config` binary is not found. You need to install LLVM development tools on your Fedora system. Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. Install LLVM development tools:

```bash
sudo dnf install llvm-devel
```
2. Verify that `llvm-config` is available:

```bash
llvm-config --version
```
3. Try installing `llvmlite` again:

```bash
pip install /home/admin/Downloads/llvmlite
```
These steps should help you resolve the issue and successfully build `llvmlite`.

jdb130496: llvmlite requires llvm 15 but I have on Fedora - llvm 19.1.5 Which package to install and how to access it because it will be side by side with my existing llvm 19.1.5

GitHub Copilot: To install LLVM 15 alongside your existing LLVM 19.1.5 on Fedora, you can use the `llvm-toolset` package from the Fedora Modular repository. Follow these steps:

1. Enable the Fedora Modular repository:

```bash
sudo dnf install dnf-plugins-core
sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled fedora-modular
```

2. Install LLVM 15 from the modular repository:

```bash
sudo dnf module install llvm-toolset-15
```

3. Verify the installation of LLVM 15:

```bash
/opt/rh/llvm-toolset-15/root/usr/bin/llvm-config --version
```

4. Set the `LLVM_CONFIG` environment variable to point to the LLVM 15 `llvm-config` binary:

```bash
export LLVM_CONFIG=/opt/rh/llvm-toolset-15/root/usr/bin/llvm-config
```

5. Try installing `llvmlite` again:

```bash
pip install /home/admin/Downloads/llvmlite
```

These steps should help you install LLVM 15 alongside LLVM 19.1.5 and build `llvmlite` using the correct version of LLVM.

jdb130496: I did not follow above path to install llvm15 but found on web and installed it:

But it is not at /opt path

GitHub Copilot: Since you have installed LLVM 15 from the rawhide repository, it should be available in the standard system paths. You can find the `llvm-config` binary for LLVM 15 and set the `LLVM_CONFIG` environment variable accordingly.

1. Locate the `llvm-config` binary for LLVM 15:

```bash
sudo find / -name llvm-config-15
```

2. Set the `LLVM_CONFIG` environment variable to point to the located `llvm-config-15` binary:

```bash
export LLVM_CONFIG=/path/to/llvm-config-15
```

Replace `/path/to/llvm-config-15` with the actual path found in the previous step.

3. Verify that the `LLVM_CONFIG` environment variable is set correctly:

```bash
$LLVM_CONFIG --version
```

4. Try installing `llvmlite` again:

```bash
pip install /home/admin/Downloads/llvmlite
```

These steps should help you build `llvmlite` using LLVM 15.

jdb130496: (.venv) [admin@fedora-rh-internal-nvme /]$ sudo find / -name llvm-config-15
find: ‘/run/user/1000/doc’: Permission denied
/etc/alternatives/llvm-config-15
/var/lib/alternatives/llvm-config-15
/usr/bin/llvm-config-15

GitHub Copilot: Great, you found the `llvm-config-15` binary at 

llvm-config-15

. Now, set the `LLVM_CONFIG` environment variable to this path and try installing `llvmlite` again.

1. Set the `LLVM_CONFIG` environment variable:

```bash
export LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/bin/llvm-config-15
```

2. Verify that the `LLVM_CONFIG` environment variable is set correctly:

```bash
$LLVM_CONFIG --version
```

3. Try installing `llvmlite` again:

```bash
pip install /home/admin/Downloads/llvmlite
```

These steps should help you build `llvmlite` using LLVM 15.

jdb130496: Give me the further clues. See below:

(.venv) [admin@fedora-rh-internal-nvme /]$ export LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/bin/llvm-config-15
(.venv) [admin@fedora-rh-internal-nvme /]$ LLVM_CONFIG --version
bash: LLVM_CONFIG: command not found
(.venv) [admin@fedora-rh-internal-nvme /]$ llvm-config --version
19.1.5
(.venv) [admin@fedora-rh-internal-nvme /]$ llvm-config-15 --version
15.0.7

GitHub Copilot: It looks like the `LLVM_CONFIG` environment variable is not being recognized as a command. You should use the correct command to set the environment variable and then use it during the `pip install` process.

1. Set the `LLVM_CONFIG` environment variable correctly:

```bash
export LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/bin/llvm-config-15
```

2. Verify that the `LLVM_CONFIG` environment variable is set correctly:

```bash
$LLVM_CONFIG --version
```

3. Install `llvmlite` using the `LLVM_CONFIG` environment variable:

```bash
LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/bin/llvm-config-15 pip install /home/admin/Downloads/llvmlite
```

This should ensure that `llvmlite` uses the correct version of `llvm-config` during the installation process.

jdb130496: That was a success - particularly this one:

LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/bin/llvm-config-15 pip install /home/admin/Downloads/llvmlite

So after building llvmlite I went to build numba from github but different errors. see below:

GitHub Copilot: The error you're encountering is due to a conflict between C++ and C linkage in the Python headers. This is a known issue when building C++ extensions for Python 3.13. To work around this issue, you can modify the `numba/_dispatcher.cpp` file to include the necessary headers with `extern "C"` linkage.

1. Open the `numba/_dispatcher.cpp` file in your editor.

2. Add the following code at the top of the file, before any other includes:

```cpp
extern "C" {
#include <Python.h>
#include <dynamic_annotations.h>
#include <pycore_pythread.h>
#include <pycore_condvar.h>
#include <pycore_gil.h>
#include <pycore_ceval_state.h>
#include <pycore_interp.h>
}
```

3. Save the file and try building `numba` again:

```bash
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

If the issue persists, you may need to adjust the include paths or the order of includes to ensure that the C linkage is correctly applied.

jdb130496: What if I am using pip install . instead of setup.py route to build?

GitHub Copilot: If you are using `pip install .` to build `numba`, you can still apply the same workaround by modifying the `numba/_dispatcher.cpp` file. Here are the steps:

1. Open the `numba/_dispatcher.cpp` file in your editor.

2. Add the following code at the top of the file, before any other includes:

```cpp
extern "C" {
#include <Python.h>
#include <dynamic_annotations.h>
#include <pycore_pythread.h>
#include <pycore_condvar.h>
#include <pycore_gil.h>
#include <pycore_ceval_state.h>
#include <pycore_interp.h>
}
```

3. Save the file.

4. Run the `pip install .` command again:

```bash
pip install .
```

This should allow the build process to proceed without encountering the C++ linkage error.

GitHub Copilot: The error indicates that the `pycore_pythread.h` header file is not found. This header file is part of Python's internal headers, which might not be available in the standard include paths. 

To resolve this, you can try to locate the internal headers and include them correctly. Here are the steps:

1. Locate the internal Python headers:

```bash
sudo find /usr/include -name pycore_pythread.h
```

2. Once you have the path to the internal headers, you can add the include directory to the `CFLAGS` environment variable before running `pip install .`.

For example, if the internal headers are located in 

internal

, you can set the `CFLAGS` environment variable as follows:

```bash
export CFLAGS="-I/usr/include/python3.13/internal"
```

3. Run the `pip install .` command again:

```bash
CFLAGS="-I/usr/include/python3.13/internal" pip install .
```

This should help the compiler find the internal headers and proceed with the build process.

jdb130496: (.venv) [admin@fedora-rh-internal-nvme numba]$ sudo find /usr -name pycore_pythread.h
/usr/include/python3.13/internal/pycore_pythread.h

GitHub Copilot: Great, you found the internal headers at 

internal

. Now, you can set the `CFLAGS` environment variable to include this directory and run the `pip install .` command.

1. Set the `CFLAGS` environment variable:

```bash
export CFLAGS="-I/usr/include/python3.13/internal"
```

2. Run the `pip install .` command:

```bash
CFLAGS="-I/usr/include/python3.13/internal" pip install .
```

This should help the compiler find the internal headers and proceed with the build process.

      compilation terminated.

GitHub Copilot: The issue is that the internal headers are not being included correctly. Let's modify the `numba/_dispatcher.cpp` file to include the internal headers with the correct path.

1. Open the `numba/_dispatcher.cpp` file in your editor.

2. Modify the includes to use the full path to the internal headers:

```cpp
extern "C" {
#include <Python.h>
#include "/usr/include/python3.13/internal/pycore_pythread.h"
#include "/usr/include/python3.13/internal/pycore_condvar.h"
#include "/usr/include/python3.13/internal/pycore_gil.h"
#include "/usr/include/python3.13/internal/pycore_ceval_state.h"
#include "/usr/include/python3.13/internal/pycore_interp.h"
}
```

3. Save the file.

4. Run the `pip install .` command again:

```bash
pip install .
```

This should ensure that the compiler finds the internal headers and proceeds with the build process.

GitHub Copilot: The errors indicate that the internal Python headers require the `Py_BUILD_CORE` macro to be defined. This macro is typically used when building Python itself, and it is not recommended to use these internal headers directly in extension modules.

Instead, you should avoid including these internal headers and find an alternative way to resolve the issue. One approach is to modify the `numba/_dispatcher.cpp` file to avoid including these internal headers.

1. Open the `numba/_dispatcher.cpp` file in your editor.

2. Remove the includes for the internal headers:

```cpp
extern "C" {
#include <Python.h>
// Remove the following lines
// #include "/usr/include/python3.13/internal/pycore_pythread.h"
// #include "/usr/include/python3.13/internal/pycore_condvar.h"
// #include "/usr/include/python3.13/internal/pycore_gil.h"
// #include "/usr/include/python3.13/internal/pycore_ceval_state.h"
// #include "/usr/include/python3.13/internal/pycore_interp.h"
}
```

3. Save the file.

4. Run the `pip install .` command again:

```bash
pip install .
```

If the build process still fails, you may need to check if there are any other dependencies or configurations required for building `numba` with Python 3.13. You can also consider using a different version of Python that is known to work with `numba`.

GitHub Copilot: The error you're encountering is due to a conflict between C++ templates and C linkage in the Python headers. This is a complex issue that arises from mixing C and C++ code. To resolve this, you can try to isolate the C++ code from the C headers.

Here is a potential workaround:

1. Open the `numba/_dispatcher.cpp` file in your editor.

2. Modify the includes to isolate the C++ code from the C headers:

```cpp
extern "C" {
#include <Python.h>
#include <dynamic_annotations.h>
#include <pycore_pythread.h>
#include <pycore_condvar.h>
#include <pycore_gil.h>
#include <pycore_ceval_state.h>
#include <pycore_interp.h>
}

#include <iostream> // or any other C++ headers you need
```

3. Save the file.

4. Run the `pip install .` command again:

```bash
pip install .
```

If this does not resolve the issue, you may need to consider using a different version of Python that is known to work with `numba`, as Python 3.13 is still relatively new and may have compatibility issues with some packages. Alternatively, you can check if there are any updates or patches available for `numba` that address this issue.

jdb130496: Okay, I could not resolve but using this link (https://github.com/numba/numba/issues/9883), I install rc2 of next numba version:



GitHub Copilot: I'm glad you found a solution by installing the release candidate (rc2) of the next version of `numba`. Using a pre-release version can often resolve compatibility issues with newer versions of dependencies.

For future reference, here are the general steps to install a pre-release version of a package using `pip`:

1. Uninstall the current version of the package if it's already installed:

```bash
pip uninstall numba
```

2. Install the pre-release version of the package:

```bash
pip install --pre numba
```

Or, if you have a specific version or release candidate you want to install, you can specify it directly:

```bash
pip install numba==0.56.0rc2

jdb130496: Now let us test functionalities of numba. How it can speed up data acces.. Give me exmaples

GitHub Copilot: Sure! `numba` is a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler that translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine code. Here are a few examples to demonstrate how `numba` can speed up data access and computation.

### Example 1: Speeding Up a Simple Loop

Without `numba`:

```python
import time

def sum_array(arr):
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        total += arr[i]
    return total

arr = list(range(1000000))
start = time.time()
print(sum_array(arr))
print("Without numba:", time.time() - start)
```

With `numba`:

```python
import time
from numba import jit

@jit(nopython=True)
def sum_array(arr):
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        total += arr[i]
    return total

arr = list(range(1000000))
start = time.time()
print(sum_array(arr))
print("With numba:", time.time() - start)
```

### Example 2: Speeding Up NumPy Operations

Without `numba`:

```python
import numpy as np
import time

def add_arrays(a, b):
    return a + b

a = np.arange(1000000)
b = np.arange(1000000)
start = time.time()
add_arrays(a, b)
print("Without numba:", time.time() - start)
```

With `numba`:

```python
import numpy as np
import time
from numba import jit

@jit(nopython=True)
def add_arrays(a, b):
    return a + b

a = np.arange(1000000)
b = np.arange(1000000)
start = time.time()
add_arrays(a, b)
print("With numba:", time.time() - start)
```

### Example 3: Speeding Up a Complex Function

Without `numba`:

```python
import time

def mandelbrot(c, max_iter):
    z = c
    for n in range(max_iter):
        if abs(z) > 2:
            return n
        z = z*z + c
    return max_iter

def create_fractal(min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, image, iters):
    height, width = image.shape
    pixel_size_x = (max_x - min_x) / width
    pixel_size_y = (max_y - min_y) / height
    for x in range(width):
        real = min_x + x * pixel_size_x
        for y in range(height):
            imag = min_y + y * pixel_size_y
            color = mandelbrot(complex(real, imag), iters)
            image[y, x] = color

image = np.zeros((500, 750), dtype=np.uint8)
start = time.time()
create_fractal(-2.0, 1.0, -1.5, 1.5, image, 20)
print("Without numba:", time.time() - start)
```

With `numba`:

```python
import time
import numpy as np
from numba import jit

@jit(nopython=True)
def mandelbrot(c, max_iter):
    z = c
    for n in range(max_iter):
        if abs(z) > 2:
            return n
        z = z*z + c
    return max_iter

@jit(nopython=True)
def create_fractal(min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, image, iters):
    height, width = image.shape
    pixel_size_x = (max_x - min_x) / width
    pixel_size_y = (max_y - min_y) / height
    for x in range(width):
        real = min_x + x * pixel_size_x
        for y in range(height):
            imag = min_y + y * pixel_size_y
            color = mandelbrot(complex(real, imag), iters)
            image[y, x] = color

image = np.zeros((500, 750), dtype=np.uint8)
start = time.time()
create_fractal(-2.0, 1.0, -1.5, 1.5, image, 20)
print("With numba:", time.time() - start)
```

These examples demonstrate how `numba` can significantly speed up Python code by compiling it to machine code. The `@jit` decorator is used to indicate that the function should be compiled by `numba`. The `nopython=True` argument ensures that the function is compiled in "nopython" mode, which is the fastest mode.

jdb130496: I got this code and saved it in a py file:

# http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/user/examples.html

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from numba import jit


@jit
def mandel(x, y, max_iters):
    i = 0
    c = complex(x, y)
    z = 0.0j

    for i in range(max_iters):
        z = z * z + c

        if z.real * z.real + z.imag * z.imag >= 4:
            return i

    return 255


@jit
def create_fractal(min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, image, iters):
    height, width = image.shape

    pixel_size_x = (max_x - min_x) / width
    pixel_size_y = (max_y - min_y) / height

    for x in range(width):
        real = min_x + x * pixel_size_x

        for y in range(height):
            imag = min_y + y * pixel_size_y

            color = mandel(real, imag, iters)
            image[y, x] = color

    return image


if __name__ == "__main__":
    image = np.zeros((500 * 2, 750 * 2), dtype=np.uint8)
    create_fractal(-2.0, 1.0, -1.0, 1.0, image, 20)

    plt.jet()
    plt.imshow(image)
    plt.show()

    Can I run it using python name of the file.py

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you can run the script using the `python` command followed by the name of the file. Here are the steps:

1. Save the code in a file, for example, `mandelbrot.py`.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.

3. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python mandelbrot.py
```

This will execute the script, generate the Mandelbrot fractal, and display it using `matplotlib`. Make sure you have the required libraries installed (`matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `numba`). If not, you can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy numba
```

After running the script, you should see a window displaying the Mandelbrot fractal.
